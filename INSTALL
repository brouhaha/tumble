tumble: build a PDF file from image files
Copyright 2003, 2017 Eric Smith <spacewar@gmail.com>

Tumble requires libtiff, which in turn requires libjpeg and zlib:

    http://www.libtiff.org/
    https://www.zlib.net/

Building Tumble requires GNU Make, GCC, Bison, and Flex, all of which are
free software provided by the Free Software Foundation.  These are provided
as part of most Linux distributions, and are also avaiable for many other
operatng systems.  See the FSF web site for more information

    http://www.gnu.org/

The supplied Makefile should work on most systems with only minor
modifications.
